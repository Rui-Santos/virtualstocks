virtualstocks
=============

virtualstocks is a "Virtual Stock Trading System" that was originally meant to be used in schools and/or universities to teach basic skills in trading w/ stocks and/or foreign currencies (Forex) w/o commercial influence.

However, the development was cancelled in late September 2013 due to multiple reasons. The code will be refactored and published on GitHub. I hope it might be useful for some people.
